# decred-canon
A collection of readings and resources to help people understand and build upon Decred. 

Sections are as follows: Getting Started, History, Hybridized PoW/PoS Consensus, Decred Governance, Politeia, Protocol Funding, Stakepools, Block Explorers, Network Data Sources, Discussion Forums, Wallets, Exchanges, Stakeholders to Follow, and Newsletters. We plan to add sections and content as they become necessary. Community members are welcome to submit pull requests for new additions. 

## Introduction

Decred is a community-directed digital currency designed to be a superior store of value for generations to come.
* Its hybrid PoW+PoS consensus mechanism, transparent proposal and voting system, and continually funded treasury, make it secure, adaptable, and self-sustaining.
* Decred stakeholders collectively determine the policy, development plan, budget, changes to the consensus rules, and they approve the miners’ work.
* Each block reward compensates miners, stakeholders, and the project Treasury (that pays contractors who work on Decred).

Decred is iterating on technological, social, and political fronts, attracting outstanding talent in the process. 

Decred: Secure. Adapatable. Self-Funding.
